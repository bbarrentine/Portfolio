                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p>My name is Brittany Barrentine and I am from Clayton, North Carolina. I am currently a student at Wake Technical Community College working towards an Associate's in Web Design 
                    along with several certificates in both Web and Graphic design. In my freetime, I am surprisingly not the leasure artist. I love spending time with and training my Doberman Pinscher, Nala!
                    I also enjoy spending time with loved ones, playing video games, and most outside adventures.

                <h2>Why do I design?</h2>
                <p>Growing up, I was never a artist. I actually do not particularly enjoy drawing in my freetime but I do love crafts and hands on projects such as home decor and painting.
                    Because of this, I always turned away to the idea of being a graphic designer even though it was the thing my parents always said I should look into. I thought I would never be good at it since I am not talented at drawing! 
                    In high school, I took a class called Multimedia Webpage Design and absolutely loved it. I did not learn too much about HTML and learned no CSS, but we did projects such as creating posters for events,
                    designing magazine covers, and even using Microsoft Word to cut images out of their backgrounds. Because I enjoyed it so much, I took what I learned and started making unique gifts for friends. Eventually, 
                    I purchased Adobe Creative Cloud and started learning Photoshop in my freetime. This was when I realized Graphic Design was the career direction I needed to pursue! I enrolled in Wake Tech and began working towards 
                    my Associates in Graphic Design. In one of my design classes, we touched on Website Designing which sounded even better. So a few weeks later, after loads of research, I switched majors from Graphic to Web Design! 
                    Both programs share classes so I am lucky to gain a good set of skills from both. And I have never looked back.
